The placement season has begun in a college. There are N number of students standing outside an interview room in a line. It is given that a person who goes in first has higher chances of getting selected. Each student has a number associated with them known as the problem-solving capability (PSC). The higher the capability, the higher the chances of selection. Now, each student wants to know the number of students ahead of him/her who have more problem-solving capability than him/her Find this number for each student.

Input Format

input1: An integer N, which denotes the number of students present.
input2: An array of size N. denoting the problem-solving capability of the students.

Constraints

1<=10<=10^7

Print output

Sample Input 0

6
4 9 5 3 2 10
Sample Output 0

0 0 1 3 4 0
Explanation 0

The first student has no one ahead of him/her. So, the answer is 0.
The second student has 9 greater than the first. So, the answer is 0.
Third student: 9 is greater than 5. So, the answer is 1.
Fourth student: 9, 4 and 5 are greater than 3. So, the answer is 3.
Fifth student: 3, 5, 9 and 4 are greater than 2. So, the answer is 4.
Sixth student: No one ahead has a greater PSC. So, the answer is 0.

Sample Input 1

5
3 4 1 5 2
Sample Output 1

0 0 2 0 3
Explanation 1

There is no element before first element then 0
Second element is greater than first element then 0
Third element 1 is less than previous 2 elements that's why 2
